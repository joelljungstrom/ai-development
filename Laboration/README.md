For the first lab of the course, I've decided to do the Hangman game.

To play the game, simply open the file and run it. Instructions will follow within the game, but basically you make a selection between 5 different categories. Depending on the selected category, the computer will generate a random word.

You'll get a hint of how many letters the word is. You then have 10 attempts to guess letters in the random word.

Good luck!
